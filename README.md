A Simple Hotel Management Smart Contract.
What are we exploring?

The Idea is quite Simple -
Consider a five star hotel where anyone can book for a hotel Room on the COmpany's website.

In this case the reservation will be made in NFT and payment will be made in that regard.

And the NFT Ownership will be timestamped. Once the duration of booking elapses, the hotel by a click and request for the NFT back and failure to sign the request will amount to IP theft.

So, let's see how we can build this.
